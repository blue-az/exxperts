# Changelog

User-visible changes per release. Historical private/internal development notes are not part of this public-facing changelog.

## Unreleased

- Rooms: quick checkpoints can be set to stop at the review gate per room (Settings, Memory pane) instead of applying automatically. Contributed by [@blue-az](https://github.com/blue-az) in [#2](https://github.com/EXXETA/exxperts/pull/2).

## 0.6.7 (2026-07-13)

- Skills: a Skills page in the web app to write a skill, upload .md/.zip/.skill files, or import from a repo, with review before accepting. Skills are enabled per room; rooms read them via a `read_skill` tool.
- Consult: a room can ask another room a question via @-mention in chat; the consulted room answers read-only from its own memory and context.
- Rooms can run delegated tasks shown as task cards in chat, and produce artifacts viewable in a sandboxed artifacts viewer.
- MCP: connectors whose providers do not support dynamic client registration (HubSpot, Gmail, Google Drive) can be added with your own OAuth app credentials via the "Custom OAuth client" section of the add-connector form; directory cards for those providers open the form prefilled.
- npm 12 installs work out of the box (`allowScripts` approvals in `package.json` plus a committed `.npmrc`); on npm 11.11+ a harmless "Unknown project config" line may print.
- Linux: the workspace folder path is typeable and a zenity-based native folder picker is available.
- CONTRIBUTING.md added; Windows clone guidance in the README.
- Hardened security headers on the web server.
