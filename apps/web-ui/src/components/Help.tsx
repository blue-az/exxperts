						<h3>Rooms</h3>
						<p>
							Each room is a persistent workspace with its own exxpert, memory, threads, and
							workspace files. Use Checkpoint to save what matters from a conversation into
							the room's memory. Maintain, on the room card, opens Learn and Review Memory,
							which turn checkpoints into lasting memory and tidy it; you sign off every
							rewrite. Room Settings holds the rest: workspace access, memory budget,
							schedules, Memento (close the current conversation without remembering it),
							and delete.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Your AI</h3>
						<p>
							Connect the AI you already have in AI setup: sign in with a subscription, paste
							an API key, or point at a company gateway. You approve which models rooms may
							use, and you switch between AI profiles right here in the settings menu.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Memory and Wallet</h3>
						<p>
							The Memory page shows what your rooms know, and HiveMind answers questions
							across all of it. The Wallet tracks spend, including background work like
							memory upkeep and scheduled runs, split into billed API spend and
							plan-covered usage, with a CSV export.
