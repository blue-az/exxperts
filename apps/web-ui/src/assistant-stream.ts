/**
 * Assistant text streaming as one explicit state machine.
 *
 * Every piece of assistant text that reaches the transcript flows through
 * this reducer — websocket deltas, end-of-message reconciliation, non-streamed
 * fallback answers, interrupts, provider auto-retries. It replaces the old
 * choreography of half a dozen refs (delta buffer, streaming id, pending
 * finalize, last-finalized guard, live-playback intervals) that all wrote to
 * shared state and produced the duplicated-answer bugs.
 *
 * The reducer is pure: (state, action) → { state, effects }. Time comes in
 * through the actions (`now`), randomness doesn't exist (item ids are
 * sequential), and the host applies the effects (one setItems per dispatch,
 * scheduling, console warnings). That makes the whole machine testable and
 * fuzzable in plain node — apps/web-server/scripts/assistant-stream-reducer-smoke.ts
 * asserts the core invariant over arbitrary event sequences (and
 * scripts/replay-stream-trace.ts feeds recorded real traces through it):
 *
 *   INVARIANT — exactly-once: for any sequence of events, including
 *   duplicated, reordered or replayed ones, each assistant message renders in
 *   exactly one transcript item, and once an answer is finalized no leftover
 *   or replayed fragment of it can ever open another item.
 *
 * Message boundaries: the agent loop guarantees message_start(assistant)
 * before the first delta and message_end after the last one (agent-loop.ts).
 * Deltas that arrive outside an open message are therefore replays or
 * emitter bugs — they are quarantined against recently finalized answers and
 * dropped with a warning instead of opening a bubble (defense in depth while
 * EXXETA_STREAM_TRACE captures the real emitter).
 *
 * Provider auto-retry: a mid-stream provider failure surfaces as message_end
 * with stopReason "error" carrying the partial content, then auto_retry_start,
 * then a full re-generation as a fresh message (agent-session.ts). Rendering
 * both attempts is the duplicated-answer bug. The reducer reserves the errored
 * item on auto_retry_start and streams the retried message into the same
 * bubble from scratch — one logical answer, one item.
 *
 * Pacing: deltas arrive in provider/proxy bursts; revealing them whole reads
 * as stutter-then-jump. Text reveals at a reading-speed band (chars/second,
 * time-based so 60Hz and 120Hz displays behave identically) with a small
 * backlog lean, fractional carry between ticks, and a jank cap so one slow
 * frame cannot burst. When generation finishes ahead of the reveal, the tail
 * keeps draining and the authoritative-text reconciliation waits for the
 * buffer to empty ("draining" phase) — no end-of-message dump.
