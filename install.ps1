# Official exxperts one-line installer (Windows PowerShell):
#
#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EXXETA/exxperts/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# What it does: checks prerequisites (Git for Windows with Git Bash, Node.js),
# clones the repo into $HOME\exxperts (override with EXXPERTS_DIR), then runs
# `npm install` and `npm run install:global`. Re-running the same command
# updates an existing install. exxperts is source-distributed, so the install
# builds the app locally; give it a few minutes.
#
# Env overrides:
#   EXXPERTS_DIR   install directory (default: $HOME\exxperts)
#   EXXPERTS_REPO  clone URL (default: https://github.com/EXXETA/exxperts.git)
