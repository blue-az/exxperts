# MCP client support

exxperts connects to MCP servers through the `mcp` extension, which is
backed by [pi-mcp-adapter](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-mcp-adapter).

## Transports

- **stdio** — local servers spawned as subprocesses.
- **HTTP** — remote servers over StreamableHTTP, with SSE fallback.
- **OAuth** — servers requiring browser login (`bearer` tokens or full
  OAuth flows). On the CLI, press `l` on a connector in the `/mcp`
  panel to log in.

## Config

Servers are read from these files, merged in precedence order:

1. `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` — shared user-global config (same file other
   MCP-capable tools use)
2. `~/.exxperts/agent/mcp.json` — exxperts user-global config
3. `.mcp.json` — project-local
4. `.pi/mcp.json` — project override

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/root"]
    },
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

On the CLI, `/mcp` opens the exxperts connectors panel
(`pi-package/extensions/mcp/connectors-panel.ts`) — the same disk-backed
view, catalog, and status language as the web Connectors page: per
server it shows the cached tool list (expand with ⏎, open a tool for
its full description), login state, and offers add from the verified
catalog or custom (`a`), remove (`x`), log in/out (`l`/`o`), and a
connection test (`t`). It warns when the config on disk has changed
since the room was opened (rooms load connector config once, at entry).
`s` (or `/mcp setup`) opens the guided setup, which can import existing
MCP configs from Cursor, Claude Code, or Claude Desktop; `/mcp
reconnect` and `/mcp tools` manage the running session's connections.

The previous config location, `~/.exxperts/app/mcp.json`, is no longer
read — move server entries into one of the files above.

In the web app, the **Connectors** page (sidebar, under Tools) shows the
same merged server list — each server's transport, which config file it
came from, its cached tools, and OAuth credential state — and manages it:
add/remove servers (saved to the exxperts user config), test a
connection, and run OAuth logins (the login opens a browser on this
machine, since the server runs locally). Backed by `GET /api/mcp/status`
and the `/api/mcp/servers` routes. Because sessions read MCP config at
session start, changes apply the next time a room is entered or resumed.

The page also includes a **directory** of verified connectors
(`apps/web-ui/src/connector-catalog.ts`): open servers that work with no
login, one-click OAuth servers (dynamic client registration verified),
token-based servers (GitHub, HubSpot — paste an API token once), and
guided entries for providers that require your own credentials. Gmail,
for example, needs your own Google Cloud OAuth client; once you have it,
add it to a config file as:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "url": "https://gmailmcp.googleapis.com/mcp/v1",
      "oauth": {
        "clientId": "…",
        "clientSecret": "…",
        "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose",
        "redirectUri": "http://localhost:19876/callback"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Behaviour

- All configured servers are exposed through a single `mcp` proxy tool
  (search / describe / call), so the model's tool surface stays small no
  matter how many servers are configured.
- Servers connect lazily on first use and disconnect after an idle
  timeout; reconnects are automatic.
- Room tool policy and the permissions extension allow the `mcp` proxy tool on both
  the web and CLI surfaces; which servers it can reach is governed
  entirely by the config files above.
- The proxy tool's description lists every configured server (including
  never-connected ones as "not connected yet"), so the model always
  knows which connectors exist without any prompt changes.
- The adapter's direct-tools/pinning feature (`directTools` in config)
  is not active in exxperts rooms: room permissions admit only the
  `mcp` proxy, on the web and the CLI alike. Rooms always use the
  proxy; pinned entries are ignored harmlessly.
- Existing outbound content-policy scanning still runs before MCP tool
  calls.
- MCP sampling (a server asking the model to complete text) stays
  disabled in headless sessions unless explicitly auto-approved in
  config.
