# Web search (SearXNG)

Web search ships **disabled**; agents say "not configured" until you turn it
on. It then runs through a local SearXNG container: no API key and no
third-party search SaaS.

**Privacy note:** SearXNG forwards your search **queries** to public search
engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, etc.), so search terms do leave the machine;
results and the rest of your data do not. Avoid searching confidential
client/internal content.

## Setup

1. **Install a container engine** (one-time, like installing Node; it can't
   be bundled). Get [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   (macOS/Windows/Linux) or, lighter on macOS, [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev).
   Open it so it's running, and set it to **start at login** so search keeps
   working after reboots.
2. **Open a new terminal** (so the freshly installed `docker` is found), then
   run the setup command from the repo directory. This starts SearXNG *and*
   writes the config for you (to `~/.exxperts/app/web-search.json`, which both
   the `exxperts` command and the repo scripts read):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/searxng start        # macOS / Linux / Git Bash
   node scripts\searxng.mjs start # Windows (PowerShell or cmd)
   ```
3. **Restart the app** (`exxperts web`, `exxperts cli`, `./scripts/exxperts-web`,
   or `./scripts/exxperts-cli`).

That's it: web search now works in both the web UI and the CLI, however you
launch them.

## How it works (and keeping it running)

SearXNG runs **inside a container**, and a container only runs while its
engine (OrbStack or Docker Desktop) is running. So the rule is simple:

- **Engine running → search works. Engine quit → search stops.**

You do **not** need a terminal open or to keep clicking anything; the engine
is a quiet background/menu-bar app. You just need it alive. To make this
effortless:

- **Turn on "Start at login"** in OrbStack/Docker settings. Then after any
  reboot the engine starts automatically, and our container is set to
  **restart with it** (`--restart unless-stopped`), so search comes back on
  its own, no command needed.

The only time search stops is if the engine is **not running** (someone quit
it, or it isn't set to start at login). You'll see an error like *"SearXNG is
not reachable at http://127.0.0.1:8888."* The fix:

```bash
open -a OrbStack          # macOS (or open Docker Desktop, on any platform)
./scripts/searxng status  # check state: running / stopped / docker unavailable
```

Other commands: `./scripts/searxng stop` / `restart`. The setup command never
overwrites an existing config, so re-running `start` is always safe.
`npm run doctor` from the repo root also checks reachability.

**Windows.** The helper is cross-platform Node; run
`node scripts\searxng.mjs <start|stop|restart|status>` from PowerShell, cmd, or
Git Bash. (Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend works well here.)

## Configuration reference

The helper writes `~/.exxperts/app/web-search.json` if no web-search config
exists yet, plus generated SearXNG settings to
`~/.exxperts/app/searxng/settings.yml` (JSON output enabled, because
`web_search` calls `/search?format=json`). Environment variables override the
shared config; see [`operations.md`](operations.md) for `EXXETA_SEARCH_*`.
