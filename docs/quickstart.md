# Quickstart

Get Exxperts running, connect your AI, and save your first memory — in about five minutes.

Exxperts is a local-first platform for persistent AI colleagues. Each "room" is an agent with durable, governed memory: everything it remembers lives in plain files on your machine, every memory write goes through an approval workflow you control, and the memory belongs to the room — not to any model vendor.

## What you need

- macOS, Windows, or Linux with a terminal. **On Windows, first install Git for Windows (Git Bash is required) and apply the two one-time Git settings from the [README's Windows quickstart](../README.md#windows-quickstart).**
- Node.js 20.6+ and npm (check with `node --version`; if missing, install the LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)).
- An AI subscription: **Claude** (Pro/Max) or **ChatGPT Plus/Pro** — or an OpenAI-compatible gateway if you or your org run one.

## 1. Install and run

The same commands work on every platform:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EXXETA/exxperts.git
cd exxperts
npm install
npm run install:global   # builds, packs, and installs the exxperts commands
exxperts web
```

The web app starts on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and opens in your browser (if it doesn't, open the URL the command prints). Everything runs locally — the server only listens on your machine.

If `install:global` fails with `ENOTEMPTY`, an older exxperts install is in the way: run `npm uninstall -g @exxeta/exxperts-app`, delete the leftover directory the error names if it survives, and retry. (The tarball it mentions is named after the npm package `@exxeta/exxperts-app` — Exxeta is the company behind exxperts.)

If it fails with `EACCES` on macOS/Linux, use a user-level npm prefix instead of `sudo`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Prefer running straight from the clone without installing commands? `npm run build`, then `./scripts/exxperts-web` (macOS/Linux/Git Bash) or `node bin\exxperts-web.cjs` (Windows).

**Updating later** — from the repo folder: `git pull`, `npm install`, `npm run install:global`. If anything misbehaves, `npm run doctor` checks every layer and prints the fix.

## 2. Connect your AI

Open **AI setup** in the web app.

- **Claude or ChatGPT Plus/Pro:** click **Sign in →** on the provider's card. The provider's login opens in a new browser tab; complete it there and the page updates by itself. Credentials stay on your machine, in the local credential store.
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway:** run `exxperts setup openai-compatible` in the terminal, then add the API key via the CLI's `/login`. Details: [Provider setup and AI profiles](provider-setup.md).

Signing in is enough — the matching profile activates by itself. You can switch between connected profiles anytime on the same page.

## 3. Create your first room

From Home, create a room. A room is a persistent colleague: it keeps its own memory, workspace, and conversation threads, and it picks a working style at creation.

Try this:

1. Chat normally — ask it to help with something real.
2. Tell it something worth keeping: *"Remember that I prefer concise summaries."*
3. When you finish the session, press **Checkpoint** next to the message box. The room distills the conversation into its durable memory — and anything you explicitly asked it to remember is protected through every later compression.

Nothing is memorized silently. Checkpoint proposals apply automatically only when they're clean; anything questionable comes back to you for review. Later, as checkpoints accumulate, the room offers **Learn** (consolidating recent context into stable memory) and **Review Memory** (tidying stable memory) — both approval-gated the same way. The full story: [Memory](memory.md).

## 4. Give the room a workspace (optional)

In the room's settings, set a **workspace folder** — the room's file tools then work inside that folder, with per-tool toggles and two access modes (**Full access** or **Bounded workspace**). Shell access is off by default.

macOS note: if the workspace is in a protected folder (Documents, Desktop, Downloads, iCloud Drive), macOS may block directory listing for the terminal that launched Exxperts. Check from that same terminal:

```bash
ls ~/Documents | head
```

If that fails with `Operation not permitted`, grant your terminal access in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files and Folders, or choose a non-protected folder.

## Where your data lives

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.exxperts/app/` | Product state: rooms (memory, events, threads), schedules, usage, artifacts, feature config. |
| `~/.exxperts/agent/` | Runtime state: provider credentials, model config, CLI sessions. |

Each room is a self-contained folder under `~/.exxperts/app/personalized-agents/<room-id>/` — its constitution, durable memory, full event history with content fingerprints, and saved threads, all in plain files you can read.

## Back up and move your rooms

Because a room is just a folder, backing it up or moving it to another machine is a copy:

1. Finish the session in the room (checkpoint if you want the latest conversation remembered) and close it.
2. Copy the room's folder — `~/.exxperts/app/personalized-agents/<room-id>/` — to the same path on the other machine (or archive it: `tar -czf my-room.tgz -C ~/.exxperts/app/personalized-agents <room-id>`).
3. On the other machine, install Exxperts and sign in to the **same provider profile** — saved threads are model-locked, so the room needs a profile that offers its model.
4. If the room had a workspace, set it again in room settings — workspace grants reference absolute paths on the original machine and don't carry over. The workspace section warns when the saved folder isn't found on this machine.

The room appears on Home automatically; no import step. Copying all of `~/.exxperts/` backs up everything, credentials included — treat that copy as sensitive.

## Uninstall

Stop the server with `Ctrl-C`. If you installed the package globally: `npm uninstall -g @exxeta/exxperts-app`. Your rooms and credentials stay in `~/.exxperts/` — delete that folder only if you want to erase all local product state.
